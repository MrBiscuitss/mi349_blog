      <p>Hello blog. I am here to teach you how to make a table. As you can see below, we have a table. 
        The one below is very basic with naught but a header, and three additional rows of data in three columns as per the assignment instructions. 
        All you have to do is follow the instructions exactly and look up how to do html and you are good to go. Unfortunately, the assignment this 
        week takes a very long time and because you had a busy weekend you will not be going to bed on time. Fortunately you’re a fast typer and an 
        even faster learner so you should be ok. Once you have constructed your table at record speed you can fill in the text that you skipped earlier 
        like so. I personally am doing this in google docs so I can view the live wordcount so that way I can stop as close to 200 words as humanely possible.
        I am very tired and just want to sleep. I have been working on this for a while now and filling in the nonsense in each of these three files is the 
        last step. I hope all my html works or I will be furious.</p>

      <table border="1">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>z</th>
            <th>y</th>
            <th>x</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>a</td>
            <td>b</td>
            <td>c</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>3</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>doe</td>
            <td>ray</td>
            <td>me</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>Hey guys. It’s me again. We really are getting close to getting done with this. In theory it’s just the easy part remaining. Should be simple but man I just want to be done. Here is a list of things that I would rather have happen than me finishing filling in the creative bits then discovering my html either doesn’t work or looks absolutely hideous. Well actually it probably won’t look good. That is to be expected. I am still just learning HTML and raw HTML doesn’t tend to look spectacular. I am getting the hang of it though. I just need to constantly cheat by looking at previous assignments or googling syntax. I will probably take the next web design class next semester, at least I want to. By the end of that I should be a pro and look back on this and be pissed it took so much work. Or I will learn nothing and still be looking back at old assignments and google for guidance. Well I kind of forgot about my original “things I would rather have happen” bit. ADHD will do that. It is of no importance to me now however as I am done.</p>
